# Instructions

 task is a placeholder request with input "hello", providing no further context or specific programming task to implement or alter. Therefore, we must clarify the intent before taking action.

## Assumptions

Since the prompt only contains "hello", we assume that the user's intent may be one of the following:

1. A request to create a minimal application that prints "Hello, World!".
2. A request to perform a system or framework initialization.
3. A misunderstanding—possibly expecting an interactive response or test of the system.

We will prepare a "Hello, World!" implementation for demonstration purposes in the context of this project.

## Files and Classes to Create

- `src/HelloWorld.php`: A class that renders "Hello, World!" message.
- `bin/hello`: A CLI script that uses the class.

## Files and Classes to Modify

None at this point unless further features are requested.

## Implementation Details

### File: src/HelloWorld.php

#### Objective

Create a simple class that returns the "Hello, World!" string.

#### Changes

```php
<?php

namespace Lack\Kindergarden;

class HelloWorld
{
    /**
     * Return the Hello, World! string
     *
     * @return string
     */
    public function sayHello(): string
    {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}
```

### File: bin/hello

#### Objective

Provide a CLI executable script that instantiates and prints the output of HelloWorld class.

#### Changes

```php
#!/usr/bin/env php
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

use Lack\Kindergarden\HelloWorld;

$hello = new HelloWorld();
echo $hello->sayHello() . PHP_EOL;
```

Make sure to run `chmod +x bin/hello` to make the script executable.

## Improvements Suggestions

To make better use of the system, consider a more specific prompt such as:

- “Create a CLI tool that outputs 'Hello, World!'. Include a class for extensibility.”
- “Build a new feature: add a class that returns a greeting depending on the time of day.”
- “Initialize a component or module called 'hello' and integrate it in the main pipeline.”
