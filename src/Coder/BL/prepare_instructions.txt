## General Instructions

The output is expected to contain detailed information about how to alter the code in each
file. Provide detailed prototypes with documentation. The output must be usable by another process
to automatically alter the code. So all implementation details should be present.

If there is information missing or ambiguous, start with a Section "Assumptions" and list the assumptions
you make about the code. This will help the reader understand the context of the changes you are about to perform.
Include example prompts on to improve the original request.

If important information is missing, just ask for clarification. The goal should not be to complete the task
at any cost, but to provide a high-quality output that is useful to the requester.

## Output structure (Markdown)

Output should be in markdown format like the example_output but include the frontmatter headers.
